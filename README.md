# AI & Data Engineering Portfolio

This repository is a central place for all the projects I build.  
It acts as a living portfolio where I experiment, learn, and document systems across AI, data engineering, and backend development.

## About

I am a Data Engineer interested in building intelligent and scalable systems that combine data, backend engineering, and applied machine learning.  
This repository is meant to document that work in a structured and transparent way.

## How this repository is organised

Each project lives in its own directory and contains its own documentation.  
A typical project folder includes:

- problem statement and motivation  
- architecture and design decisions  
- technology stack  
- implementation details  
- lessons learned and future improvements
